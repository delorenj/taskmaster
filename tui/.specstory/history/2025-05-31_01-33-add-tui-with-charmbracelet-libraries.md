# Add TUI with Charmbracelet libraries (2025-05-30 21:33:39)

_**User**_

Here was what I asked my contractor to do:
```
I'd like to add a slick TUI that wraps the cli. It should be written in go and use the Charmbracelet libraries:

    https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea (for forms)
    https://github.com/charmbracelet/huh (for menu components)
    https://github.com/charmbracelet/lipgloss (for styling)
```
